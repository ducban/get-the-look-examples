# Get the Look Examples

These example html pages were built for Sean McBride's "Get the Look: Use
@Font-Face + CSS3 Like the Stars" presentation.

Check out the [main presentation page](http://seanmcb.com/get-the-look/) for
links to slides, audio, and other resources.

## A note about the fonts

The kits from [Typekit](http://typekit.com) that I'm using in these examples
are referrer-protected. They'll load successfully as long as the domain in the
url bar is ```seanmcb.com``` or ```localhost```. If you have ```file://``` or
a different domain, the fonts won't load.

If you don't know how to make a simple local server to try these out, check out
[XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html) or the
[Python SimpleHTTPServer](http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/tech-tip-really-simple-http-server-python)
for a quick and easy way to serve some static files on ```http://localhost```.
